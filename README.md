# Blockchain for Federated Learning in the Internet of Things: Trustworthy Adaptation, Standards, and the Road Ahead

As edge computing gains prominence in Internet of Things (IoTs), smart cities, and autonomous systems, the demand for real-time machine intelligence with low latency and model reliability continues to grow. Federated Learning (FL) addresses these needs by enabling distributed model training without centralizing user data, yet it remains reliant on centralized servers and lacks built-in mechanisms for transparency and trust. Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) can fill this gap by introducing immutability, decentralized coordination, and verifiability into FL workflows. This article presents current standardization efforts from 3GPP, ETSI, ITU-T, IEEE, and O-RAN that steer the integration of FL and blockchain in IoT ecosystems. We then propose a blockchain-based FL framework that replaces the centralized aggregator, incorporates reputation monitoring of IoT devices, and minimizes overhead via selective on-chain storage of model updates. We validate our approach with IOTA Tangle, demonstrating stable throughput and block confirmations, even under increasing FL workloads. Finally, we discuss architectural considerations and future directions for embedding trustworthy and resource-efficient FL in emerging 6G networks and vertical IoT applications. Our results underscore the potential of DLT-enhanced FL to meet stringent trust and energy requirements of next-generation IoT deployments.
This repository sets up a local IOTA sandbox using Docker Compose for testing and experimentation with the IOTA Tangle. It uses the Hornet node along with necessary INX plugins such as the coordinator, faucet, and dashboard.

## Components

- **DLT-Adapter**: Verifies identity, filters redundant data, submits model hashes to Tangle.
- **DLT-Verifier**: Validates updates, assigns reputation scores.
- **DLT-Aggregator**: Computes global model from verified updates.
- **DLT-DApp Manager**: Orchestrates interactions among modules.
- **Off-chain Repository**: Stores actual model weights securely.


##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

---

### Start the Sandbox

To start the sandbox environment:

```bash
cd ~/iota-sandbox/sandbox
docker compose up -d
```

Check that the containers are running:

```bash
docker ps
```

You should see services like:
- `hornet`
- `inx-coordinator`
- `inx-faucet`
- `traefik`

---

## Steps to Restart & Repeat Your IOTA Sandbox Transaction Tests

Use this section to reset and re-run your transaction testing setup at any time.

---

### Get Hornet’s IP Address

Run the following command to get Hornet's internal Docker IP:

```bash
docker inspect -f '{{range.NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' hornet
```

This will return something like:

```
172.18.211.11
```

Copy this IP to use in your API requests.

---

### Verify Hornet is Running

Use the following command to check if Hornet is healthy:

```bash
curl -X GET http://<Hornet-IP>:14265/api/core/v2/info
```

Example:

```bash
curl -X GET http://172.18.211.11:14265/api/core/v2/info
```

If you see `"isHealthy": true`, then Hornet is running correctly.

---

### Send a Test Transaction

```bash
time curl -X POST http://<Hornet-IP>:14265/api/core/v2/blocks \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "protocolVersion": 2,
    "parents": [],
    "payload": {
      "type": 5,
      "tag": "0x48656c6c6f2054616e676c65",
      "data": "0x48656c6c6f2054616e676c65"
    }
  }'
```

Example output:

```json
{"blockId":"0xd235e1faf9a96a55d971e0d7139c1b1e43561a204148b379080e5779a18d3075"}
```

---

### Verify the Sent Transaction

Use the `blockId` returned in the previous step:

```bash
curl -X GET http://<Hornet-IP>:14265/api/core/v2/blocks/<blockId>
```

Example:

```bash
curl -X GET http://172.18.211.11:14265/api/core/v2/blocks/0xd235e1faf9a96a55d971e0d7139c1b1e43561a204148b379080e5779a18d3075
```

If you see the block data, the transaction was successfully submitted to the Tangle.

---

### Automate Multiple Transactions (with Latency Logging)

Use this loop to send 10 transactions and log the latency of each:

```bash
for i in {1..10}; do
  echo "Sending transaction #$i..." | tee -a latency_results.txt
  { time curl -X POST http://<Hornet-IP>:14265/api/core/v2/blocks \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "protocolVersion": 2,
      "parents": [],
      "payload": {
        "type": 5,
        "tag": "0x546573745472616E73616374696F6E",
        "data": "0x48656c6c6f2054616e676c65"
      }
    }' ; } 2>> latency_results.txt
done
```

Replace `<Hornet-IP>` with the actual IP you got in step 1.
